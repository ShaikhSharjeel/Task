Banner Manager is an interactive web application developed using React, designed to allow users to efficiently manage and update a website banner. The application features a dynamic banner that includes a countdown timer and a clickable link. Users can manage the banner's settings through an internal dashboard, where they can update the banner's description, visibility, timer, and link. These changes are reflected in real-time on the banner, providing a seamless user experience. The application integrates with a backend API to ensure persistent data storage and retrieval, leveraging a MySQL database for backend operations. This setup not only enhances user interaction but also maintains consistent data management across sessions.
